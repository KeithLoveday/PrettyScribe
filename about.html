    PrettyScribe is a simple single-page web application that renders BattleScribe roster files in a (hopefully) useful 
    format for viewing on device or printing. The PrettyScribe application is inspired by the (poorly named but 
    quite useful) <a href="http://www.buttscri.be/">ButtScribe</a> application.

    Currently PrettyScribe supports roster files for Warhammer 40k, Warhammer 40k Kill Team and Warhammer Age of Sigmar.
    
    This work was started as an exercise in learning web-development (Javascript, Typescript, etc.) 
    and a passion for the table-top wargamming hobby in general.
    
    PrettyScribe is very much a work in progress. Suggestions, bugs, comments are welcomed.  PrettyScribe is 
    an open-source project and can be found on Github at, <a href="https://github.com/rweyrauch/PrettyScribe">Source Code</a>.
    
    If you actually use this tool and find it useful let me know.

    PrettyScribe was inspired by a simalar tool called <a href="http://www.buttscri.be/">ButtScribe</a>.
    ButtScribe works reasonably well, but does not reliably import compressed roster files (.rosz).
    PrettyScribe works with compressed roster files.

    PrettyScribe runs completely in the browser and can format large roster files.
