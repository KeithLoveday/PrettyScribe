# PrettyScribe

PrettyScribe is a simple single-page web application that renders BattleScribe roster files in
a (hopefully) useful format for viewing on device or printing.   The PrettyScribe application
is inspired by the (poorly named but quite useful) ButtScribe, http://www.buttscri.be/, application.

Currently PrettyScribe supports roster files for Warhammer 40k, Warhammer 40k Kill Team and
Warhammer Age of Sigmar.

This work was started as an exercise in learning web-development (Javascript, Typescript, etc.) and
a passion for the table-top wargamming hobby in general.

PrettyScribe is very much a work in progress.   Suggestions, bugs, comments are welcomed.

If you actually use this tool and find it useful let me know.
